# Closeout, archive, and recovery

A managed task is archive-eligible only when live state proves all of the
following:

- terminal completed state, or an explicitly blocked terminal handoff;
- final result read;
- reconciliation against required deliverables and dependencies;
- no transient needs-attention state or unread user-input/review request;
- exact task and optional host IDs captured;
- archive intent recorded before mutation.

A completed issue session is not archive-eligible until an independent review
has a terminal `clear` outcome for the same full live base/head pair. Supply
those freshly resolved revisions when recording archive intent and resolve and
revalidate them again immediately before accepting the authoritative archive
result. A blocked issue session may use its explicit blocked handoff instead.
Archive the terminal review first, then archive its implementation subject;
capacity-deferred review therefore keeps the implementation task, branch, and
worktree recoverable.

Archive eligible managed tasks automatically during requested closeout.
Archive is reversible; task deletion is never allowed. Do not archive running,
waiting, needs-attention, ambiguous, unrelated, or still-needed tasks. A
blocked issue session is archive-eligible only after its explicit terminal
handoff is read and reconciled; an ordinary blocked observed peer remains
ineligible.

For an issue-owned or review session, archival is followed by the exact safe
worktree cleanup sequence in its lifecycle reference. Archive success does not
prove cleanup. Dirty, unmerged, active, shared, ambiguous, or evidence-bearing
resources are preserved and reported instead of deleted. A stale review may be
archived and cleaned, but it never satisfies the implementation review gate.

Record archive success only from authoritative tool success/readback. Keep the
orchestration task unarchived until it has delivered the final coordination
readback. Self-archive only when explicitly requested or through a later safe
completion action.

To recover a known task:

1. resolve the exact project-scoped register;
2. match an exact task ID, or one unambiguous retained display title;
3. ask for clarification when multiple records match;
4. unarchive the exact ID;
5. read live state and return it to the managed set.

Never guess an archived task ID.

A terminal completed or blocked review may be recovered independently for
inspection even when its implementation subject remains archived. A pending or
active review requires its subject task, branch, and worktree to be recovered
first; recovery does not grant authority to restart or mutate either task.

Schema-v2 registers that retained abbreviated Git revisions are upgraded only
after Git re-resolves the abbreviation in the exact recorded worktree to one
unambiguous full object ID. If that worktree is unavailable or the abbreviation
is ambiguous, preserve the register, restore the worktree, and retry; never pad,
guess, or silently discard the managed-session record. Canonicalize legacy
worktree spellings during migration and fail closed if two records resolve to
the same filesystem identity.
