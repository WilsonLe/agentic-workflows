# Project taste record

Use accepted decisions to make later work more consistent. Start by looking for existing project context such as DESIGN.md, PRODUCT.md, a component library, or a design-system document. Follow that project's conventions and update the existing record when substantive work or an explicit user correction warrants it.

For a substantial new surface where reusable design context is desired and no record exists, use a small project-local document such as `docs/frontend-design.md`. Avoid creating a competing system file, adding a dossier for a small fix, or storing project/customer details in global skills or memory.

## Compact structure

```markdown
# Frontend design decisions

## User and task
- Role and immediate purpose:
- Primary action and successful outcome:
- Surface and important states:

## Accepted taste
- Decision:
- Reason tied to user purpose:
- Scope or exception:
- Provenance: explicit user instruction / accepted project design

## Information and disclosure
| Information | Initial or deferred | Trigger | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## System
- Existing tokens/components and any deliberate additions:
- Interaction, responsive, and accessibility decisions:

## Corrections and open hypotheses
- Correction, reason, and what it supersedes:
- Unconfirmed hypothesis and how to validate it:

## Verification
- Rendered states/journeys checked:
- Remaining limitations:
```

Record specific reasons: “Keep the manager's member count linked to Members because it starts routine people management” is useful. “Make it clean and modern” is not enough to guide a later decision.

Label agent proposals as hypotheses until accepted through explicit feedback or the project's normal decision process. Silence is not approval. When the user corrects a decision, amend or supersede the old rule so future agents do not treat both as active. Retain only the context needed to apply the correction.

Keep product-specific exceptions scoped. “Instructor bulk actions appear after selection” should not become “hide all secondary actions everywhere.” A data-heavy comparison table and a sparse onboarding view can both satisfy purposeful minimalism.

When applying this plugin in a different project, carry the general principles and read that project's accepted context. Do not carry private data, identifiers, or one product's incidental styling into another.
